# SVD Applications
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is one of the most general-purpose tools in numerical linear algebra for data processing. The data reduction mechanism of SVD allows us to identify the key features of big data, that are necessary for analysing, understanding and describing the features.

In this repository, we have primarily focused on compressing images with high resolution using SVD.
